# AI Chatbot

## Introduction

The **AI Chatbot** is a simple web-based application that leverages AI to interact with users. This chatbot processes natural language input and generates meaningful responses, offering an engaging user experience. The project integrates **front-end** and **back-end** technologies, combining **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the user interface and **Python with Flask** for backend services.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A clean, intuitive user interface for seamless communication with the chatbot.
- **Dynamic AI-Powered Responses**: Generates real-time responses based on user input.
- **Customizable Backend**: Built with Flask, allowing easy modification of the AI model or response logic.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- **Open Source**: Community contributions are encouraged to expand and improve the project.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML**: Structure of the application.
  - **CSS**: Styling and design.
  - **JavaScript**: Dynamic interactions and logic.

- **Backend**:
  - **Python** (Flask): API handling and AI model integration.

- **Optional**: Node.js (for potential future features, such as real-time updates or external integrations).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the AI Chatbot locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js** (optional for advanced features)
- A modern **web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-GenZ/ai-chatbot.git
cd ai-chatbot
```

### Setup on Linux and macOS

#### Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ai-chatbot
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip3 install flask flask-cors
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

   The server will start locally on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Frontend Setup

1. Open the **`index.html`** file in your preferred web browser.
2. This launches the chatbot interface, which communicates with the backend to generate AI-powered responses.

### Setup on Windows

Follow the same steps as above, but use the following commands where applicable:

- For creating a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- Start the backend server:

  ```bash
  python server.py
  ```

## Usage

1. Launch the frontend by opening the **`index.html`** file in your browser.
2. Type a message or question into the input box and press **Send**.
3. The chatbot will process your input and display its response in the chat interface.
4. Continue the conversation by entering more messages.
